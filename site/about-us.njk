            Our Story
        </h2>
        <p class="text-lg md:text-xl text-gray-700 pb-4">
            It began back in March 2020 when a few friends desperately wanted to help their local hospitals. They’d heard that at the end of long shifts battling COVID-19, frontline NHS staff were faced with the disheartening sight of closed canteens and nothing to eat.
        </p>
        <p class="text-lg md:text-xl text-gray-700 pb-4">
            A few phone calls later, and our first delivery was made to the Whittington Hospital on 23rd March. From then on, we set out to sign up hospitals who needed our help, and find the volunteers and funds to make it happen. We knew local restaurants needed a lifeline too to survive the economic fallout of COVID-19, so we onboarded small businesses where these deliveries could make a big impact and together. We got to work delivering Meals for the NHS.
        </p>

                    This all started with a small group of friends, but delivering hundreds of thousands of meals needed help. We now have a small army of incredibly talented and experienced operators, tech and process geeks and logistics experts from companies including Deliveroo, Uber, Monzo, Spotify, Google, McKinsey and many more, all giving their time.
