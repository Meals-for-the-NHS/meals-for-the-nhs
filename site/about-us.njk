            Our Story
        </h2>
<!--        <p>
            It began back in March 2020 when a few friends desperately wanted to help their local hospitals. Theyâ€™d heard that at the end of long shifts battling COVID-19, frontline NHS staff were faced with the disheartening sight of closed canteens and nothing to eat.</p>
        <p>
            A few phone calls later, and our first delivery was made to the Whittington Hospital on 23rd March. From then on, we set out to sign up hospitals who needed our help, and find the volunteers and funds to make it happen. We knew local restaurants needed a lifeline too to survive the economic fallout of COVID-19, so we onboarded small businesses where these deliveries could make a big impact and together. We got to work delivering Meals for the NHS.</p>
-->
            <p class="italic">(Thatâ€™s a wrap! Weâ€™ve made our final delivery of Meals to the NHS, for now.)</p>

            <p>Meals for the NHS began on 21st March 2020, with a group of friends becoming increasingly concerned about overwhelmed and overworked NHS staff battling COVID-19. </p>

            <p>Working shifts up to 14-hours long, with no access to food after 5pm and PPE restrictions making it almost impossible to find a meal outside hospital walls - NHS staff had a serious problem, and it needed to be solved. </p>

            <p>We focused on <strong>5 Guiding Principles</strong> as we grew out our organisation: </p>

            <ol class="mx-10">
                <li>Move fast, help now</li>
                <li>Effortless for all</li>
                <li>Keep it local</li>
                <li>Adapt and learn</li>
                <li>Weâ€™re not precious</li>
            </ol>
            <p>With an outpouring of support from the general public helping to raise over Â£1.8m from over 17,000 donors, our growing team of +100 determined volunteers got to work, sourcing hospital contacts and delicious food providers and funding...</p>

            <p>Fast forward 101 days (30th June 2020), and as we saw hospitals reduce their orders for meals as COVID-19 cases subsided, we wrapped up our mission.</p>

            <p>With the help of our amazing food providers, weâ€™ve delivered 300,000th meal to the incredible people on the NHS frontline covering 125 hospitals. We are so proud of what weâ€™ve collectively achieved with you all in this period of time and we want to thank you wholeheartedly for your continued support. </p>

            <p>As our journey comes to a close, we hope that you too can look back with pride, knowing youâ€™ve helped make a real difference during an unbelievably difficult time.</p>

            <p>With ðŸ’™.<br />

        <p>This all started with a small group of friends, but delivering hundreds of thousands of meals needed help. We built up a small army of incredibly talented and experienced operators, tech and process geeks and logistics experts from companies including Deliveroo, Uber, Monzo, Spotify, Google, McKinsey and many more, all giving their time.</p>
        <p>Together we worked out how to spend your donations in the best possible way to get food to NHS staff.</p>

        <h2>Our 5 Principles</h2>

        <ol class="principles">
            <li>
                <b>1. Move Fast, Help Now</b>
                <p>NHS hospital staff need help yesterday. If thereâ€™s a scrappy way to get meals to them quicker, we do it.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>2. Effortless for NHS staff</b>
                <p>They are saving lives, letâ€™s make this magically simple for them. We should make getting dinner as easy as sending a text.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>3. Help local restaurants</b>
                <p>We give local people and local restaurants a way to support the staff saving their neighboursâ€™ lives.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>4. Listen, learn and adapt</b>
                <p>Do they need halal? Vegan? Chocolate biscuits? We listen, learn and adapt - regardless of the challenge.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>5. We're not precious</b>
                <p>If we see a chance to collaborate, share, contribute to any other work we can help with, we will, with open arms.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
