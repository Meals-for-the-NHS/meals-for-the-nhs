We wanted to share our journey with you and ask you to donate one last time!  It began back in March, and with the help of: üôã over 100 volunteers üçî 222 food providers (who were also in desperate need of a lifeline) üéâ and a whopping ¬£1,736,696 in donations ...we have: üè• fed 118 hospitals  üòã delivered 233,928 meals!  We‚Äôre SO proud to have achieved this, but recently we‚Äôve been really happy to see many of the hospitals we‚Äôre working with reduce their orders for meals as COVID-19 cases begin to subside.  While we acknowledge there may well be a ‚Äòsecond wave‚Äô coming, we can‚Äôt predict when. So while we have the money to buy meals and the volunteers to make it happen, we want to make this time count.  That‚Äôs why we‚Äôve come to the decision to work towards The Big Finish for Meals for the NHS, with a target of delivering a final total of 285,000 meals to our amazing NHS frontline.  Donations will close on 16th June 2020, so if you'd like to give us a final helping hand, you have until then to donate üíô #FeedTheFrontline #MealsForTheNHS #ThankYouNHS"

That is the driving principle behind Meals for the NHS. That‚Äôs why we want to come together in solidarity with the Black Lives Matter movement. We stand with our Black volunteers, food providers, NHS staff and donors.  The many appalling events that have happened in the US, UK and elsewhere, cannot be ignored. Put simply: racial injustice must not be tolerated. Period. During our remaining time of supporting the NHS and food providers through the crisis, we are creating a forum for discussions with our volunteers to educate ourselves more."

Their initiative to provide nutritious meals for our frontline health workers was no brainer so we quickly decided to jump on board to be part of the movement for humanity. In just over a month of deliveries to our frontline NHS we produced over 5,000 meals and dropped them off to 11 different hospitals across London and of course this wouldn‚Äôt have been possible without the support and encouragement we got from Meals for the NHS. A special thanks to everyone at Meals for the NHS for making this possible, to financially support small independent businesses in daunting circumstances (such a relief), keeping our sanity in check when things weren‚Äôt looking good and simply giving us a lifeline and a reason to smile, we salute you! And for every NHS frontline hero reading this, from doctors to the nurses, the porters to the paramedics, you are the real life heroes! Putting your own life at risk to save ours means the world. Utmost respect for your bravery and courageous spirit, thank you!‚Äù  #SupportSmallBusiness #FeedTheFrontlines #MealsForTheNHS"

With all the street food markets closed, we faced a critical moment, and then thankfully, Meals for the NHS got in touch.  Today, Meals for the NHS pays both mine and my wife's wages - this not only helps us cover our expenses, but it also helps us give economical support to my parents, who are part of the at risk group.

The nurses and doctors we meet when dropping off the food are always looking forward to us arriving, they always have smiles on their faces and the thanks we get is sometimes overwhelming.  ‚ÄúThis is all down to ‚ÄòMeals for the NHS‚Äô and the donors that support them.
